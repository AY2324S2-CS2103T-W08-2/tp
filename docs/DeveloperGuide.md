### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shutdown.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ClinicParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ClinicParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ClinicParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Timetable component

**API** : [`CalendarFx`](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX)
1. The `CalendarFx` library is used to display the appointments in a calendar view.
2. The timetable class create a CalendarView and display the appointments in the calendar view.
3. The timetable class listens to changes observableList<Appointment> and observableList<Person> in the model and updates the entries in CalendarView accordingly.
4. Timetable contains a thread that updates the time pointer of CalendarView every 5 minutes to reflect the latest time.
  
[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the clinic data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* each `Person` has 3 types of information, the [`Identification Information`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/model/person/identificationinformation), the [`Contact Information`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/model/person/contactinformation) and the [`Medical Information`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/model/person/medicalinformation).
* each of the information can be expanded upon easily to add future additions such as emergency contact, etc.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/vitalconnect/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both clinic data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ClinicStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `vitalConnectbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation of Undo**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism uses polymorphism. Every command implements the execute and undo methods. Upon execution, the command is stored in a stack. If the user performs an `Undo` command, the command at the top of the stack is popped and the undo method of the command is executed. If the command contains a way for undoing, then it will perform the undo. If it doesn't, such as the `List` or `Help` command, then it will pop and repeat the process on the next item on the stack until there are no longer any items.
The `CommandHistoryManager`â€‰is a singleton that manages a history of the user commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandHistoryManager` will be initialized with no commands.

Step 2. The user executes the `delete 2` command to delete the 2nd person in the clinic. The `delete 2` command attempts to execute and upon executing successfully, it is then pushed into the command history stack via `CommandHistoryManager.getInstance().pushCommandToHistory()`. Note that only successful executions will be pushed.

Step 3. The user then executes the `Undo` command which will pop the latest command via `CommandHistoryManager.getInstance().popCommandToHistory()`. The latest command will then execute their undo method which in this case is the `delete 2` command. 

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 :** Saves the entire clinic data.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `add`, just save the person being added).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

## **Implementation of Appointments**

This section provides details on how the appointment-related functionalities are implemented in the application.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### **Creating Appointments**

The feature for creating appointments allows users to schedule new appointments by providing a patient's NRIC, start time, and duration. The implementation ensures that the appointment does not conflict with existing appointments and that it is set in the future.

Here's how it works:
- **Model Interaction**: The `CreateAptCommand` interacts with the model to check if the patient exists and whether the proposed time conflicts with existing appointments.
- **Validation**: Checks include validating the time format, ensuring the time is not in the past, and that the appointment duration is within allowable limits.
- **State Saving**: Upon successful creation, the appointment state is saved in the model, allowing for future queries or modifications.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. The user inputs the command to create an appointment with specific details.
2. The system validates the input, checks for conflicts, and if all checks pass, the appointment is added to the system.
3. The user receives confirmation that the appointment has been successfully scheduled.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### **Editing Appointments**

Users can edit existing appointments by specifying the appointment index along with new time and/or duration. This functionality ensures that any modifications do not cause scheduling conflicts.

Steps involved:
- **Fetch and Modify**: The command fetches the existing appointment from the model using the provided index, and then modifies the specified fields.
- **Conflict Check**: Before finalizing the changes, the system checks for any potential conflicts with other appointments.
- **Commit Changes**: If no conflicts are found, the changes are committed to the model.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. The user issues a command to edit an appointment.
2. The application retrieves the appointment, applies the changes, and checks for conflicts.
3. If no conflicts are detected, the changes are saved, and the user is informed of the successful update.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### **Finding Appointments**

This feature allows users to find all appointments associated with a particular patient by their NRIC. It serves as a quick access point to view all related appointments.

Implementation specifics:
- **Query Execution**: The command queries the model for appointments using the patient's NRIC.
- **Result Presentation**: The appointments, if any, are formatted and presented to the user.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. A user requests to view appointments for a specific patient using their NRIC.
2. The system retrieves all matching appointments and displays them.
3. If no appointments are found, a message indicating this is shown to the user.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### **Deleting Appointments**

The feature for deleting appointments allows users to remove scheduled appointments by specifying their index within the list of all appointments. This functionality ensures that appointments are accurately identified and removed without affecting other entries.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

#### Implementation Details

- **Command Usage**: The `DeleteAptCommand` accepts an index, which corresponds to the position of the appointment in the list as displayed in the UI.
- **Validation**: The system checks if the index provided is within the valid range of existing appointments.
- **Deletion Process**: If the index is valid, the specified appointment is removed from the model.
- **Update UI**: Post deletion, the UI updates to reflect the changes, removing the appointment from the displayed list.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. **User Action**: The user issues a command to delete an appointment by specifying its index.
2. **System Processing**: The application checks the validity of the index and, upon confirmation, deletes the appointment.
3. **Feedback**: The user is notified of the successful deletion, and the appointment list is updated to exclude the deleted appointment.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### **Design considerations**

**Aspect: Handling Overlapping Appointments**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Prevent any overlapping appointments.
  * Pros: Simplifies management of appointments, clear schedule.
  * Cons: Less flexibility for users.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow overlaps under certain conditions.
  * Pros: More flexibility for users.
  * Cons: Increases complexity in managing schedules.

## **Timetable**

The timetable feature allows users to view all appointments scheduled for a specific day. This feature provides a consolidated view of the day's appointments, aiding in planning and organization.

### Calendar View Integration:
1. The class uses the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) library to implement the calendar view.
2. The setUpCalendarView() method configures various aspects of the CalendarView, such as styling, toolbars, search functionality, and context menus.

### Appointment List Management:
1. The Timetable class observes changes in the ObservableList of appointments (appointmentList). It updates the calendar view accordingly when appointments are added, removed, replaced, or updated.
2. The addAppointmentToCalendar() method adds a new appointment to the calendar view by creating an Entry object with appropriate details and adding it to the calendar.

### Person List Integration:
1. Although not directly related to appointments, the class also observes changes in the ObservableList of persons (personList). This is because the UI needs to update when person details change.
2. When a person's details change, the corresponding entries in the calendar view are updated to reflect the changes. Since appointments only change when user use 'lista' command(surprising?), and the calendar view can not wait for 'lista' command.

### Real-time Clock Update:
1. The class includes a background thread (updateTimeThread) that continuously updates the current date and time displayed in the calendar view every 30 seconds.
2. This ensures that the calendar view always displays the current date and time without requiring manual refresh.

### Example Usage Scenario:
1. The user navigates to the timetable view to see all appointments scheduled for the day.
2. The calendar view displays a list of appointments with details such as patient name, appointment time, and duration.
3. The user can interact with the calendar view to view additional details, modify appointments, or add new appointments.
4. The calendar view automatically updates in real-time to reflect any changes made to appointments or patient details.
5. If enough pixels are available, the calendar view will display a agenda.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Technical Requirements
1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.

#### Performance Requirements
1. Should be able to hold up to 100 patients with 1000 appointments without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
2. The system should respond within 3 seconds.

#### Quality Requirements
1. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
2. System should be robust for any form of data file crashes and invalid user input.

#### Scope
1. The product will <strong>NOT</strong> enforce any form of protection of the generated data file containing patients' information. The organization should be responsible for ensuring the safety of their patient's data.

#### Process Requirements
1. The project is expected to grow in a breadth-first iterative process.
