**This product is a destop application for managing your patient information such as medical, contact or appointment information.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).


If you are relatively good at typing, having the benefit of CLI of reducing time of dragging your mouse around, vitalConnect empowers you to manage your appointments swiftly and effectively. With its intuitive interface and robust features, you can add, delete, and search for appointments, track medical information, as well as check patient contact for communication with ease.


If you're a busy professional juggling multiple appointments, vitalConnect is here to simplify your life. Let's dive in and explore how vitalConnect can revolutionize the way you manage your appointment and patient.
